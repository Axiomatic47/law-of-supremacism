We define key terms, present an axiomatic system, and prove—using formal logic—that sustained conflict implies a hierarchy in which at least one entity asserts superiority. Implications for fields such as sociology, political science, and computational modeling are discussed."

      "content_level_3": "\n\n### 1.1 Background\n\nConflict is a pervasive phenomenon across social, political, economic, and abstract systems. Traditional analyses have considered various triggers and structures of conflict, yet a common thread remains: sustained conflict appears intrinsically tied to assertions of superiority or dominance.\n\n### 1.2 Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind this paper is to rigorously examine whether sustained conflict can exist without any supremacist elements. By formalizing this relationship, we aim to advance our understanding of conflict dynamics and provide a foundation for further interdisciplinary research.\n\n### 1.3 Overview\n\nThis paper is organized as follows:\n\n* **Section 2:** Formal Definitions\n* **Section 3:** Axiomatic System for the Fundamental Law of Supremacism\n* **Section 4:** Formal Logical Proof\n* **Section 5:** Summary of Formal Representations\n* **Section 6:** Implications and Applications\n* **Section 7:** Conclusion\n* **Section 8:** References and Appendices"

For example, a society, a political system, or even a logical framework.\n* **Entity (E)**\\\n  An agent, object, or concept within a system that participates in interactions.\n* **Conflict (C)**\\\n  A sustained state of opposition between two or more entities. Formally,\n\n  C⊂S\n* **Sustained Conflict (SC)**\\\n  Conflict that persists over time, beyond isolated or transient disputes.\n\n  SC(C) indicates conflict that endures for t>0.\n* **Hierarchical Differentiation (H)**\\\n  A structural arrangement where entities are ranked or differentiated by a measure of validity or power.\n\n  H(Ex​,Ey​) means Ex​ is positioned as superior to Ey​.\n* **Supremacy (P)**\\\n  The assertion or claim that one entity is inherently more valid, dominant, or legitimate than another.\n\n  P(Ex​,Ey​) denotes that Ex​ asserts its superiority over Ey​.\n* **Neutral Interaction (N)**\\\n  Interaction where entities engage without any claim of superiority.\n\n  N={Ex​,Ey​∣¬P(Ex​,Ey​)}."

By defining key terms, presenting an axiomatic system, and proving through formal logic that sustained conflict necessarily implies supremacist claims, we reinforce the notion that supremacy is an invariant feature of conflict.
