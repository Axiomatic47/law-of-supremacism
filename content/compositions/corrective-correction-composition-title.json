Federal Election Commission*, 558\n\nU.S. 310 (2010), marks a pivotal shift in the interpretation of corporate speech rights\n\nunder the First Amendment, fundamentally altering the landscape of campaign finance\n\nlaws and democratic governance. The decision departed significantly from established\n\nprecedents such as *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990), and\n\n*McConnell v. Federal Election Commission*, 540 U.S. 93 (2003), disrupting the principle\n\nof stare decisis that promotes stability, continuity, and predictability in the law. By\n\ngranting corporations the right to spend unlimited amounts in political campaigns, the\n\nCourt empowered a single voice—the voice of corporate wealth—to dominate political\n\ndiscourse, effectively drowning out the voices of individual citizens.\n\nAnalogy Illustrating the Overpowering Effect of Broad Corporate Free Speech\n\n2. 3. To understand the impact of the *Citizens United* decision, consider an analogy: it is like\n\nempowering a single voice with an unlimited volume in a crowded room. Although all\n\nparticipants are theoretically free to speak, the one with the capacity to amplify their\n\nvoice the loudest inevitably dominates the conversation. This unchecked amplification\n\ndoes not merely allow that voice to be heard; it effectively silences others, preventing\n\nalternative perspectives from emerging and undermining the very foundation of free\n\nspeech—the equal opportunity to participate in democratic discourse.\n\nThis analogy illustrates how the broad interpretation of corporate free speech rights\n\ngranted in *Citizens United* defeats the end goal of the First Amendment itself. The\n\npurpose of free speech is not just to protect expression but to ensure a robust, balanced\n\nexchange of ideas essential for a functioning democracy. When one voice, enabled by\n\nimmense corporate wealth, overpowers all others, the democratic process is\n\ncompromised. The principle of political equality—where each citizen's voice should\n\ncarry equal weight—is undermined. Thus, unrestricted corporate speech rights do not\n\nprotect free speech; they distort it, turning it into a tool for amplifying the interests of the\n\nfew over the many, contrary to the Constitution's intent to \"establish Justice\" and\n\n\"promote the general Welfare.\"\n\nChallenging Citizens United: Departures from Precedent, Disruption of\n\nDemocratic Principles, and the Need for Reconsideration\n\n4. *Citizens United* represents a significant departure from earlier Supreme Court rulings that\n\nrecognized the government's interest in limiting corporate influence to protect democratic\n\nintegrity. Both *Austin* and *McConnell* upheld restrictions on corporate political spending\n\nto prevent corruption and maintain democratic fairness. By overturning these decisions,\n\nthe Court disregarded established standards for overturning precedent, including the\n\nrequirement to demonstrate that the previous decisions were egregiously wrong or had\n\nbecome unworkable.5. 6. 7. The decision's failure to justify this dramatic shift and its disregard for reliance interests\n\nhave disrupted established regulatory frameworks, undermining political equality and\n\npublic trust. Empirical evidence shows an increase in corporate influence in elections and\n\nwidespread public disapproval, contradicting the Constitution’s commitment to political\n\nequality and the general welfare.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution, particularly James Madison, emphasized the need to\n\ncontrol the effects of factions, especially those driven by concentrated wealth, through a\n\nrepublican government that protects against undue influence. By allowing unrestricted\n\ncorporate spending, *Citizens United* undermines this original intent and the foundational\n\nprinciple of democratic governance \"by the people.\"\n\nIn conclusion, *Citizens United* has empowered an overwhelming corporate voice in\n\nAmerican democracy, subverting the First Amendment's purpose of equal participation.\n\nReconsidering this broad interpretation of corporate speech rights is essential to restoring\n\nconstitutional balance, protecting dem",

      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n\nI. Citizens United Overturned Established Precedents\n\n8. The Supreme Court's decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558\n\nU.S. 310 (2010), represents a significant departure from the doctrine of *stare decisis*,\n\nwhich requires courts to adhere to established precedents to promote legal stability,\n\ncontinuity, and predictability. By overturning or significantly altering key precedents\n\nrelated to corporate speech rights and campaign finance, *Citizens United* undermined the\n\ntraditional reliance on precedent in ways that were neither justified nor consistent with\n\nthe Court’s prior practices.\n\n9. Overruling of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990):\n\nA. In *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, the Supreme Court upheld a\n\nMichigan law restricting corporate political spending, recognizing the state's\n\ncompelling interest in preventing \"the corrosive and distorting effects of immense\n\naggregations of wealth\" accumulated through the corporate form. *Austin* reflected\n\na commitment to protecting the integrity of democratic processes from\n\ndisproportionate corporate influence. See *Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Com.*, 494\n\nU.S. 652, 660 (1990).\n\nB. However, in *Citizens United*, the Court explicitly overruled *Austin*, rejecting the\n\nnotion that preventing distortion in the political process was a sufficient\n\njustification for limiting corporate political expenditures. *Citizens United* marked\n\na sharp departure from precedent, disregarding the state's recognized interest in\n\nlimiting corporate influence over elections and undermining the Court’s prior\n\ncommitment to maintaining balanced political participation. *Citizens United*, 558\n\nU.S. at 365–66.\n\n10. Invalidation of McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U.S. 93 (2003):A. B. In *McConnell v. Federal Election Commission*, the Supreme Court upheld key\n\nprovisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), including\n\nrestrictions on \"electioneering communications\" funded by corporations and\n\nunions. The Court in *McConnell* emphasized the government’s compelling\n\ninterest in preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption in\n\nelectoral processes. See *McConnell v. FEC*, 540 U.S. 93, 115 (2003).\n\nBy contrast, *Citizens United* invalidated portions of the BCRA that restricted\n\ncorporate political spending, effectively overturning critical aspects of the\n\n*McConnell* decision. This reversal occurred despite the fact that *McConnell* had\n\nbeen decided only seven years earlier, and without demonstrating substantial\n\nchanges in law or factual circumstances that would justify such a drastic departure\n\nfrom the principles of *stare decisis*. *Citizens United*, 558 U.S. at 365–66.\n\nII. Citizens United’s Deviation from Established Stare Decisis Principles\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in *Citizens United* deviated from its own established standards for\n\nwhen it is appropriate to overturn precedent, as articulated in prior cases such as *Planned*\n\n*Parenthood v. Casey*, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).\n\n11. Lack of Justification for Overturning Precedent:\n\nA. The Court typically considers multiple factors when deciding whether to overturn\n\na precedent, including whether the prior decision was egregiously wrong,\n\nunworkable, affected by significant changes in factual or legal circumstances, or\n\nif reliance interests are at stake. *Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey*, 505 U.S.\n\n833, 854–55 (1992).\n\nB. *Citizens United* failed to provide a compelling justification for overturning *Austin*\n\nand *McConnell*. The Court did not demonstrate that these precedents were\n\nunworkable or that there had been significant changes in factual or legal\n\ncircumstances to warrant a departure from established precedent. Instead, the\n\ndecision seemed driven more by a change in the Court's composition and judicial\n\nphilosophy rather than by substantive new evidence or compelling changes in\n\ncircumstances. *Citizens United*, 558 U.S. at 364.\n\n12. Disregard for Reliance Interests:\n\nA. The doctrine of *stare decisis* also takes into account whether overturning a\n\nprecedent would disrupt reliance interests. Individuals, businesses, and\n\ngovernments often rely on established legal principles to plan their actions and\n\nstructure their policies. See *Casey*, 505 U.S. at 854.\n\nB. By overturning *Austin* and parts of *McConnell*, *Citizens United* disrupted\n\nsignificant reliance interests, particularly in how federal and state governments\n\nregulate campaign finance. This shift undermined a well-established regulatory\n\nframework based on the principles upheld in those earlier decisions, disregarding\n\nthe traditional factors considered under *stare decisis*. *Citizens United*, 558 U.S. at\n\n365–66.III. Citizens United Demonstrates Flexibility in the Application of Stare Decisis\n\n13. Precedent for Overturning Established Decisions:\n\nA. By overturning or significantly altering *Austin* and *McConnell*, *Citizens United*\n\ndemonstrates that the Supreme Court is willing to depart from precedent when it\n\nbelieves a prior decision was wrongly decided or does not align with its current\n\ninterpretation of constitutional principles. *Citizens United*, 558 U.S. at 365–66.\n\nB. If *Citizens United* itself departed from the doctrine of *stare decisis*, this sets a\n\nsignificant precedent for future challenges to the decision. The Court's readiness\n\nto overturn prior rulings, particularly without demonstrating the requisite\n\ncompelling reasons—such as unworkability or substantial changes in legal or\n\nfactual contexts—suggests that *Citizens United* lacks the enduring stability\n\ntypically associated with Supreme Court precedents. This willingness to depart\n\nfrom precedent, as demonstrated in *Citizens United*, invites re-evaluation of the\n\ndecision, especially if new, compelling arguments or evidence are presented that\n\nreveal its detrimental impact on democratic governance, political equality, or the\n\nintegrity of the electoral process. Additionally, the Court has historically\n\nreconsidered prior rulings when it recognized that those decisions were not only\n\nwrongly decided but also when they conflicted with fundamental constitutional\n\nvalues, as seen in landmark cases such as *Brown v. Board of Education*, 347 U.S.\n\n483 (1954), which overturned *Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). Similarly,\n\nif it can be demonstrated that *Citizens United* has undermined the foundational\n\nprinciples of democracy by fostering systemic corruption and eroding political\n\nequality, the decision’s departure from *stare decisis* principles could justify its\n\nreconsideration in favor of a narrower interpretation that better aligns with\n\nconstitutional objectives of fairness, equality, and protection against undue\n\ninfluence in political processes.\n\n14. Precedents Supporting Flexible Application of Stare Decisis:\n\nA. Historical precedents, such as *Brown v. Board of Education*, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),\n\ndemonstrate that the Court can and does overturn precedent when societal values,\n\nempirical evidence, or understandings of constitutional principles evolve. *Brown*\n\noverturned *Plessy v. Ferguson*, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), and its doctrine of \"separate\n\nbut equal,\" recognizing that the prior decision was fundamentally inconsistent\n\nwith constitutional values of equality and justice. *Brown*, 347 U.S. at 494–95.\n\nB. If the Court could overturn the deeply entrenched doctrine of \"separate but equal\"\n\ndue to its conflict with core constitutional values, it can similarly reconsider\n\n*Citizens United* if it is shown that the decision undermines democratic integrity,\n\npolitical equality, and the general welfare.\n\nIV. Stare Decisis in Favor of Narrower Interpretations of Corporate Speech Rights\n\n15. Argument for Returning to Narrower Interpretations:\n\n*Stare decisis* should favor returning to earlier interpretations that support a narrower\n\nunderstanding of corporate speech rights, as reflected in *Austin* and *McConnell*. Byarguing that *Citizens United* defied this principle without sufficient justification, there is a\n\ncompelling case for returning to those precedents that better align with democratic values\n\nand constitutional objectives.\n\n16. In conclusion, the significant departure from established precedent in *Citizens United*,\n\nwithout adequate justification or consideration of reliance interests, undermines the\n\ndecision’s credibility as a binding precedent. By highlighting how *Citizens United* itself\n\ndeparted from the doctrine of *stare decisis*, this petition effectively neutralizes arguments\n\nfor upholding the decision solely on the grounds of precedent. The demonstrated\n\ninconsistency with *stare decisis* principles supports the need for a return to a narrower\n\ninterpretation of corporate speech rights, more consistent with the Constitution’s intended\n\nobjectives of political equality, prevention of corruption, and protection of democratic\n\nintegrity.\n\nIV. The Departure from Stare Decisis in Citizens United v. FEC\n\nA. How Citizens United Overturned Established Precedents\n\n17. The Supreme Court's decision in *Citizens United v. FEC*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), marked a\n\nsignificant departure from established precedents regarding corporate speech rights and\n\ncampaign finance laws, thereby deviating from the doctrine of stare decisis. Two key\n\nprecedents that were overturned or significantly altered by *Citizens United* include:\n\n18. Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990):\n\nIn *Austin*, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law that restricted corporate spending on\n\npolitical campaigns, recognizing the state’s compelling interest in preventing the\n\n\"corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\" accumulated\n\nthrough the corporate form. This decision established that corporate spending in elections\n\ncould be limited to prevent undue influence over the political process. However, *Citizens*\n\n*United* explicitly overruled *Austin*, rejecting the idea that preventing distortion of political\n\nprocesses by corporate wealth was a sufficient justification for limiting corporate political\n\nexpenditures. This reversal represents a profound shift away from prior rulings that\n\nrecognized the state's interest in limiting corporate influence over elections.\n\n19. McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U.S. 93 (2003):\n\n*McConnell* upheld most provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA),\n\nincluding restrictions on \"electioneering communications\" funded by corporations and\n\nunions. The Court acknowledged the government's compelling interest in preventing\n\ncorruption and the appearance of corruption. However, *Citizens United* invalidated\n\nportions of the BCRA that restricted corporate political spending, effectively overturning\n\nparts of the *McConnell* decision. This showed a lack of adherence to stare decisis,\n\nespecially considering that *McConnell* had been decided only seven years before *Citizens*\n\n*United*.\n\nB. Deviation from Stare Decisis Principles\n\nThe decision in *Citizens United* can be argued to have violated the Court’s own standards for\n\nwhen it is appropriate to overturn precedent, as outlined in previous cases:20. Factors for Overturning Precedent\n\nThe Supreme Court typically considers several factors when deciding whether to overturn\n\nprecedent, including whether the prior decision was egregiously wrong, whether it has\n\nproven to be unworkable, whether there have been changes in factual or legal\n\ncircumstances, and whether reliance interests are at stake (*Planned Parenthood v. Casey*,\n\n505 U.S. 833, 854 (1992)). In *Citizens United*, however, the Court did not provide a\n\ncompelling justification for why the precedents set by *Austin* and *McConnell* should be\n\noverturned. The Court failed to demonstrate that these earlier decisions were unworkable\n\nor that significant factual changes had occurred to warrant a departure from established\n\nprecedent. The decision seemed more driven by a change in the Court's composition and\n\njudicial philosophy rather than by new evidence or compelling changes in circumstances.\n\n21. Disregarding Reliance Interests\n\nThe doctrine of stare decisis also considers whether overturning a precedent would\n\ndisrupt reliance interests, which are the expectations that individuals, businesses, and\n\ngovernments develop based on established legal principles. By overturning *Austin* and\n\nparts of *McConnell*, *Citizens United* disrupted significant reliance interests, particularly\n\nconcerning how federal and state governments regulate campaign finance. This shift\n\nundermined a well-established regulatory framework that had been built around the\n\nprinciples upheld in those earlier decisions, disregarding the traditional factors considered\n\nunder stare decisis.\n\nC. Citizens United Demonstrates Flexibility in Stare Decisis\n\n22. Precedent for Overturning Precedent\n\nBy overturning or significantly altering *Austin* and *McConnell*, *Citizens United*\n\ndemonstrates that the Supreme Court is willing to depart from precedent when it believes\n\na prior decision was wrongly decided or does not align with its current interpretation of\n\nconstitutional principles. This sets a precedent for future challenges to the decision. The\n\nCourt’s willingness to overturn prior decisions opens the door for reconsideration of\n\n*Citizens United*, particularly if new and compelling arguments or evidence emerge that\n\nhighlight the decision’s detrimental impact on democratic governance and political\n\nequality.\n\n23. Flexible Application of Stare Decisis in Other Cases\n\nOther cases, such as *Brown v. Board of Education*, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), demonstrate that\n\nthe Court can and does overturn precedent when societal values, empirical evidence, or\n\nthe understanding of constitutional principles have evolved. *Brown* overturned *Plessy v.*\n\n*Ferguson* and its doctrine of “separate but equal,” showing that the Court may reconsider\n\neven long-standing precedents when justified. If the Court could overturn the deeply\n\nentrenched doctrine of “separate but equal” due to its conflict with constitutional values\n\nof equality and justice, it can similarly reconsider *Citizens United* if it is shown that the\n\ndecision undermines democratic integrity, political equality, and the general welfare.\n\nD. Utilizing the Doctrine of Stare Decisis to Argue Against Citizens United24. Favoring Narrower Interpretations\n\nStare decisis should favor returning to earlier interpretations that support a narrower\n\nunderstanding of corporate speech rights, as seen in *Austin* and *McConnell*. By arguing\n\nthat *Citizens United* defied this principle without sufficient justification, there is a\n\ncompelling case for returning to those precedents that better align with democratic values\n\nand constitutional objectives.\n\n25. In conclusion, by demonstrating how *Citizens United* itself departed from the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis without adequate justification, it effectively neutralizes the argument that the\n\ndecision should be upheld solely because it is precedent. The decision's disregard for\n\nestablished precedent opens the door for further reconsideration, particularly given its\n\nsignificant implications for political equality, prevention of corruption, and the general\n\nwelfare. This approach supports a compelling case for returning to a narrower\n\ninterpretation of corporate speech rights in line with the Constitution's intended\n\nobjectives.",

      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n26. This section examines the competing interests between narrow and broad interpretations\n\nof corporate speech rights under the First Amendment. It assesses when constitutional\n\nvalues serve as means to the ends set forth by the Preamble, and when these values are\n\nends in themselves. This framework aims to provide guidance on how to prioritize such\n\nvalues based on their constitutional objectivity.\n\nA. Narrow Interpretation of Corporate Speech Rights\n\n27. A narrow interpretation of corporate speech rights focuses on limiting corporate influence\n\nin political processes to protect political equality, prevent corruption, and safeguard\n\ndemocratic integrity. Key precedents supporting a narrow interpretation include:\n\n28. Political Equality and Fair Participation:\n\na. The Constitution's commitment to “establish Justice” and “promote the general\n\nWelfare” in the Preamble suggests a democratic society should ensure fair\n\npolitical participation for all citizens. A narrower interpretation of corporate\n\nspeech rights limits corporate influence, ensuring that individuals' voices are not\n\novershadowed by the financial power of corporations, thereby promoting equality\n\nin political discourse.\n\nb. This perspective aligns with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection\n\nClause, which suggests that each person should have an equal say in the\n\ndemocratic process (*Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976)). By limiting corporate\n\nspending rights, the Court can prevent wealth from distorting this fundamental\n\nprinciple, aligning the interpretation with the Preamble’s directive to promote\n\njustice and general welfare.29. Preventing Corruption and Safeguarding Democratic Integrity:\n\na. The government has a compelling interest in preventing corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption, as recognized in cases like *Austin v. Michigan Chamber*\n\n*of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990). By limiting corporate influence in elections, a\n\nnarrow interpretation helps maintain public trust in democratic institutions,\n\naligning with the Preamble’s call to “insure domestic Tranquility” and “promote\n\nthe general Welfare.”\n\nb. Reducing corporate dominance in political processes helps maintain a democratic\n\nsystem that reflects the will of the people rather than being unduly influenced by\n\nconcentrated wealth (*McConnell v. Federal Election Commission*, 540 U.S. 93\n\n(2003)).\n\n30. Promoting the General Welfare:\n\na. The objective to “promote the general Welfare” suggests that laws and\n\nconstitutional interpretations should benefit society as a whole. Limiting corporate\n\npolitical speech helps prevent policy outcomes that disproportionately favor\n\ncorporate interests over the needs and rights of the broader population. This\n\napproach guards against oligarchy, preventing the concentration of power among\n\na small number of wealthy corporate entities that could undermine democratic\n\nprinciples (*Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990)).\n\n31. Securing Liberty and Justice for All:\n\na. The Preamble’s goal of “securing the Blessings of Liberty” can be interpreted to\n\nmean that liberty should be preserved for individual citizens, not extended\n\nuncritically to artificial entities like corporations. Limiting corporate speech rights\n\nensures that the democratic freedoms of natural persons are protected by ensuring\n\ntheir voices are heard equally in the political process. This interpretation aligns\n\nwith the commitment to “establish Justice” by preventing corporate wealth from\n\ndistorting elections.\n\nB. Broad Interpretation of Corporate Speech Rights\n\n32. A broad interpretation of corporate speech rights, as seen in *Citizens United v. FEC*, 558\n\nU.S. 310 (2010), emphasizes the protection of free speech under the First Amendment,\n\nextending this protection broadly to all entities, including corporations. This perspective\n\nis grounded in several constitutional values:\n\n33. Freedom of Speech and Expression:\n\nThe First Amendment explicitly protects freedom of speech, which is viewed as an\n\nabsolute value that should extend to all entities, including corporations (*Citizens*\n\n*United v. FEC*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)). A broad interpretation ensures that all voices,\n\nincluding those of corporate entities, are included in public discourse, reflecting acommitment to free expression. Preventing government censorship is a key principle\n\nhere; restricting corporate speech could be seen as a dangerous precedent allowing the\n\ngovernment to regulate or limit speech based on the speaker’s identity or content,\n\ncontrary to the First Amendment’s purpose of protecting against government control\n\nover speech.\n\n34. Liberty and Autonomy:\n\nThe Preamble’s goal of “securing the Blessings of Liberty” can be interpreted to\n\nmean protecting the freedom of all entities, including corporations, to participate in\n\npolitical processes without undue restriction. This perspective aligns with a libertarian\n\nview that maximizes freedom by minimizing government interference. Corporations\n\ncan be seen as associations of individuals who have pooled resources to amplify their\n\ncollective voice. Restricting corporate speech rights could infringe on the rights of\n\nindividuals to associate and express their views collectively, thus undermining liberty\n\n(*NAACP v. Alabama*, 357 U.S. 449 (1958)).\n\n35. Promoting the General Welfare Through Diverse Information:\n\nA broad interpretation supports the First Amendment's role in ensuring a free\n\nmarketplace of ideas, where all voices can be heard, and truth can emerge from public\n\ndebate. Allowing corporate entities to contribute their perspectives enriches public\n\ndiscourse and promotes the general welfare by ensuring a well-informed electorate\n\n(*First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti*, 435 U.S. 765 (1978)).\n\n36. Justice Through Neutral Government Regulation:\n\nEnsuring that the government does not impose arbitrary or biased restrictions on\n\nspeech is a fundamental aspect of justice. A broad interpretation of corporate speech\n\nrights is consistent with the Preamble's commitment to “establish Justice” by ensuring\n\nthat the government remains neutral regarding who can participate in public discourse\n\n(*Citizens United v. FEC*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)).\n\nC. When Constitutional Values Are Means Versus Ends\n\n37. The Constitution’s Preamble articulates the foundational purposes of the document: to\n\n\"form a more perfect Union,\" \"establish Justice,\" \"insure domestic Tranquility,\" \"provide\n\nfor the common defense,\" \"promote the general Welfare,\" and \"secure the Blessings of\n\nLiberty.\" These goals provide the ends toward which the Constitution’s various\n\nprovisions are directed. Understanding when constitutional values are means or ends is\n\ncritical in resolving conflicts between them:\n\n38. Values as Means:\n\nWhen constitutional values, such as freedom of speech, are viewed as instrumental, they\n\nserve as means to achieve broader constitutional goals. For instance, freedom of speech is\n\nconsidered a means to ensure democratic governance, political equality, and thepromotion of general welfare. In this context, the right to free speech is not an absolute\n\nend but a tool to facilitate public discourse, prevent government tyranny, and ensure a\n\ngovernment accountable to the people (*Whitney v. California*, 274 U.S. 357 (1927),\n\nBrandeis, J., concurring).\n\n39. Values as Ends:\n\nOther constitutional values, such as political equality and preventing corruption, can be\n\nconsidered ends in themselves, directly tied to the Constitution's goals of \"establishing\n\nJustice\" and \"promoting the general Welfare.\" These values aim to create a fair and just\n\nsociety and prevent the concentration of power that undermines democratic integrity.\n\nEnsuring political equality and preventing corruption are not merely tools for achieving\n\nother goals but are foundational principles that define the nature of American democracy\n\n(*Reynolds v. Sims*, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)).\n\nD. Prioritizing Competing Values Based on Constitutional Objectivity\n\n40. To prioritize competing values, courts should consider which values directly advance the\n\nConstitution's objectives and which serve as means to those ends. Values that are ends in\n\nthemselves, such as political equality and preventing corruption, should be given greater\n\nweight when they conflict with values that are means, such as unrestricted corporate\n\nspeech. This approach aligns with a purposive interpretation of the Constitution that\n\nprioritizes democratic integrity, equality, and the general welfare over absolute freedoms\n\nthat could undermine these objectives.\n\n41. The prioritization of values should focus on their role in achieving the Constitution’s\n\nprimary goals. When unrestricted corporate speech threatens political equality, increases\n\nthe risk of corruption, or undermines democratic integrity, limitations become necessary\n\nto protect the broader constitutional values enshrined in the Preamble. This reasoning\n\nsupports a narrower interpretation of corporate speech rights that balances the First\n\nAmendment against the Constitution’s broader commitment to justice, democracy, and\n\nequality (*Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976); *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of*\n\n*Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990)).\n\nArguing Against Broad Corporate Speech Rights\n\nI. Corporations as Artificial Entities: Recognizing Their Limited Constitutional Rights\n\n42. Corporations, as creations of state law, lack the inherent qualities of natural persons, such\n\nas moral agency and autonomy, which justify constitutional rights. The Supreme Court\n\nhas acknowledged these distinctions by limiting corporate rights in several contexts, such\n\nas the lack of Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination (*Hale v. Henkel*,\n\n201 U.S. 43, 74 (1906)) and reduced privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment\n\n(*California Bankers Ass'n v. Shultz*, 416 U.S. 21 (1974)). Similarly, the First Amendment\n\nshould not afford corporations unrestricted rights to political speech that can undermine\n\ndemocratic values like equality and fairness. Instead, corporate rights should beinterpreted more narrowly, in line with their function as economic entities rather than\n\nparticipants in democratic self-governance.\n\nII. Challenging the Concept of Corporate Personhood\n\n43. The notion of “corporate personhood,” used to justify broad corporate rights, lacks a firm\n\nfoundation in constitutional text. Corporations are not mentioned in the Constitution, nor\n\ndoes it grant them personhood equivalent to natural persons. The Court's decision in\n\n*Citizens United* expanded corporate rights beyond what was constitutionally intended.\n\nRevisiting the scope of corporate personhood would ensure that corporations do not\n\npossess the same political rights as individuals, preserving the Constitution’s intent to\n\nprotect democratic governance against undue influence from concentrated economic\n\npower.\n\nIII. Expanding the Definition of Corruption to Include Systemic and Structural Issues\n\n44. The Court's narrow definition of corruption in *Citizens United*, limited to quid pro quo\n\narrangements, fails to account for broader systemic corruption. This narrow view\n\ndisregards the significant influence that corporations exert over the political process\n\nthrough substantial financial contributions, undermining the democratic integrity that the\n\nConstitution seeks to protect. A more comprehensive definition, as suggested by *Buckley*\n\n*v. Valeo* (424 U.S. 1, 26-27 (1976)), should encompass undue influence and structural\n\ncorruption, where the political system is disproportionately swayed by corporate wealth,\n\ndistorting public trust and equal representation.\n\nIV. Distinguishing Corporate Rights Based on Function\n\n45. A nuanced approach should differentiate corporate entities based on their societal roles.\n\nWhile media corporations may require certain First Amendment protections due to their\n\nrole in public discourse, non-media corporations, whose primary purpose is economic,\n\nshould not receive the same latitude in political spending. This distinction allows for\n\nreasonable campaign finance regulations that limit corporate influence while protecting\n\nthe freedom of speech for entities that contribute directly to public debate, aligning with\n\nconstitutional objectives of fair and equitable elections.\n\nV. Citizens United’s Precedent and Flexibility in Applying Stare Decisis\n\n46. *Citizens United* itself demonstrates the Court's flexibility in applying stare decisis. It\n\noverturned established precedents, such as *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce*\n\n(494 U.S. 652 (1990)), which upheld restrictions on corporate political spending to\n\nprevent the \"corrosive and distorting effects\" of corporate wealth. It also reversed parts of\n\n*McConnell v. FEC* (540 U.S. 93 (2003)), which supported the Bipartisan Campaign\n\nReform Act's restrictions to prevent corruption. This deviation from stare decisis without\n\ndemonstrating that the previous decisions were \"egregiously wrong\" or \"unworkable,\"\n\nand without considering reliance interests, suggests that a return to a narrower\n\ninterpretation is both appropriate and necessary to align with constitutional principles.47. In conclusion, this section advocates for a reconsideration of corporate political rights by\n\nasserting that broad interpretations undermine constitutional values, including equality,\n\nfairness, and democratic integrity. The Constitution does not afford corporations the same\n\nrights as individuals, particularly where those rights distort the political process. A\n\nnarrower interpretation, consistent with constitutional objectives, would restore balance,\n\nprioritize democratic governance, and align with the framers' intent to ensure a\n\ngovernment accountable to the people rather than to concentrated wealth."

      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n48. Citizens United's Departure from Stare Decisis Principles *Citizens United* overturned\n\nor significantly altered several key precedents related to corporate speech rights and\n\ncampaign finance, demonstrating a deviation from the doctrine of stare decisis. The\n\ndecision explicitly overruled *Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce* (1990), where\n\nthe Supreme Court had upheld restrictions on corporate spending in political campaigns\n\nto prevent the \"corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\"\n\naccumulated through the corporate form. Additionally, it partially overturned *McConnell*\n\n*v. FEC* (2003), which recognized the government's compelling interest in preventing\n\ncorruption and maintaining the integrity of democratic processes. This departure from\n\nestablished precedent calls into question the justification for granting corporate entities\n\nthe same First Amendment rights as individuals when such a decision undermines the\n\nConstitution's intent to promote equality and democratic governance (Brennan Center for\n\nJustice).\n\n49. Empirical Evidence of Increased Corporate Influence and Public Disapproval\n\nFollowing the *Citizens United* decision, there has been a demonstrable increase in the\n\ninfluence of corporate money in American elections. Corporations, nonprofits, and\n\nunions, leveraging their substantial financial resources, have dramatically increased\n\nspending on political campaigns. The removal of restrictions on independent political\n\nexpenditures by corporations has led to an influx of corporate money that has reshaped\n\nthe political landscape, creating an environment where corporate interests can\n\novershadow the political voices of individual citizens (Brennan Center for Justice).\n\nThe decision has been met with substantial public opposition, reflecting a widespread\n\nperception that it has eroded democratic values. Polls conducted by Washington Post–\n\nABC News, Common Cause, People for the American Way, and Pew Research Center\n\nshortly after the decision consistently found that a significant majority of Americans—\n\nacross the political spectrum—disapproved of the ruling. Approximately 80% of\n\nrespondents opposed the decision, with 65% expressing \"strong\" opposition. These\n\nfindings underscore a shared public sentiment that corporate influence in politics is\n\nalready excessive and should be curtailed to protect the integrity of democratic processes\n\n(Brennan Center for Justice).50. Erosion of Democratic Values and Political Equality The *Citizens United* ruling has\n\nbeen criticized for undermining the democratic principle of political equality by\n\nprioritizing corporate speech rights over those of individuals. By permitting unlimited\n\ncorporate spending in political campaigns, the decision has facilitated a political\n\nenvironment where corporate entities, with their substantial financial resources, exert\n\ndisproportionate influence over elections and policymaking. This reality contradicts the\n\nConstitution's commitment to \"establish Justice\" and \"promote the general Welfare\" as\n\narticulated in the Preamble (Brennan Center for Justice).\n\n51. The *Brennan Center for Justice* argues that *Citizens United* effectively reordered the\n\npriorities in American democracy, centering special interest dollars rather than the voices\n\nof individual voters. This reordering has diminished the role of the electorate in\n\ndemocratic processes, allowing wealthy corporations to dominate the political discourse\n\nand decisions. Such a trend not only violates the principle of \"one person, one vote\" but\n\nalso erodes public trust in democratic institutions, which is essential for a healthy and\n\nfunctioning democracy (Brennan Center for Justice).\n\n52. Compelling Government Interest in Preventing Corruption and Maintaining\n\nDemocratic Integrity The government has a compelling interest in preventing both\n\nactual corruption and the appearance of corruption in democratic processes. Empirical\n\ndata suggests that corporate spending leads to perceived and actual corruption, which in\n\nturn erodes public trust in governance. Allowing unlimited corporate expenditures fosters\n\nan environment where policymakers may become more responsive to wealthy corporate\n\ndonors than to their constituents, thus perpetuating systemic corruption and weakening\n\nthe democratic fabric of the nation. This aligns with the government's recognized interest,\n\nas articulated in previous cases like *Austin* and *McConnell*, to maintain a democratic\n\nsystem that reflects the will of the people rather than being unduly influenced by\n\nconcentrated wealth (Brennan Center for Justice)."

The decision has\n\nresulted in significant adverse consequences for the democratic process and public trust,\n\nundermining the constitutional values it purports to protect.

      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n54. Argument: The framers of the Constitution, particularly James Madison, articulated a\n\nvision for a government that would protect against both the tyranny of the majority and\n\nthe undue influence of powerful minorities, including those driven by economic interests.\n\nIn *Federalist No. 10*, Madison highlighted the inherent dangers posed by factions—\n\ngroups united by a common interest adverse to the rights of others or the overall good ofthe community. He acknowledged that the root causes of faction, such as the unequal\n\ndistribution of property, were inevitable in a free society. The challenge, therefore, was\n\nnot to eliminate factions—an impossible task without abolishing liberty itself—but to\n\ncontrol their effects through a republican form of government that could refine and\n\nenlarge the public views and prevent any single faction from dominating the political\n\nprocess (*The Federalist No. 10* (James Madison), *Constitution Center*).\n\n55. Madison argued that in a large republic, a diversity of interests would make it more\n\ndifficult for any one faction to gain control, thus promoting stability and protecting\n\nindividual rights. He emphasized that \"the most common and durable source of factions\n\nhas been the various and unequal distribution of property,\" thereby recognizing the\n\ndangers of concentrated economic power in influencing governance. This understanding\n\naligns with the framers' intention to protect democratic integrity by preventing factions,\n\nparticularly those with significant economic power, from subverting the political process\n\n(*The Federalist No. 10*).\n\n56. Support from Modern Academic Interpretations: Contemporary scholars have built\n\non this originalist perspective, arguing for a constitutional interpretation that evolves to\n\nmeet present-day challenges. John Hart Ely, in *Democracy and Distrust*, argues that the\n\nframers did not intend for the Constitution to be interpreted rigidly; rather, they designed\n\nit with broad principles meant to adapt to future needs. Ely contends that the\n\nConstitution’s primary purpose is to ensure a government accountable to the people,\n\nwhich necessitates a flexible interpretation that prevents any faction, including\n\neconomically powerful entities like corporations, from undermining democratic processes\n\n(*John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review*).\n\n57. Philip Bobbitt, in *Constitutional Fate*, emphasizes that the Constitution should be\n\nunderstood as a living framework for governance that adapts with societal changes. He\n\nargues that the framers intended for the Constitution to be applied in a way that protects\n\nthe public good and evolves to address new challenges. Similarly, Cass Sunstein, in *The*\n\n*Partial Constitution*, warns that adhering strictly to the framers’ original meaning might\n\nfail to protect minority rights and respond adequately to modern political realities.\n\nSunstein advocates for a constitutional interpretation that actively works to prevent any\n\nsingle faction—such as corporate entities with disproportionate influence from decisions\n\nlike *Citizens United*—from distorting democratic governance (*Philip Bobbitt,*\n\n*Constitutional Fate: Theory of the Constitution; Cass R. Sunstein, The Partial*\n\n*Constitution*).\n\n58. In conclusion, by invoking the original intent of the Constitution's framers, this petition\n\nargues for a reconsideration of the corporate speech rights established in *Citizens United*\n\n*v. FEC*. The framers aimed to prevent factions, particularly those fueled by economic\n\ninterests, from subverting democratic processes. Restricting corporate political spending\n\naligns with this vision by preserving the integrity of a government intended to be \"by the\n\npeople\" and ensuring that no single faction can dominate the political landscape. Thisinterpretation is supported by both Madison’s original arguments in the *Federalist Papers*\n\nand modern academic scholarship, which emphasize the need for a dynamic\n\nunderstanding of constitutional principles that responds to contemporary economic and\n\npolitical realities."

      "title": "Historical Precedents Viewing Freedom of Speech as Instrumental",
      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n59. The Supreme Court has historically treated freedom of speech as an instrumental right—\n\nvaluable but not absolute. The Court has consistently upheld that speech may be limited\n\nwhen it conflicts with essential democratic values or public interests, such as public\n\nsafety, preventing corruption, and maintaining political equality. This approach balances\n\nthe right to free expression with the broader goals of democratic governance.\n\nKey Precedents Illustrating the Instrumental Nature of Free Speech\n\n60. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919): In *Schenck*, the Court upheld Charles\n\nSchenck's conviction under the Espionage Act for distributing anti-draft leaflets during\n\nWorld War I. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., introduced the \"clear and present\n\ndanger\" test, arguing that freedom of speech does not protect expressions that pose a\n\nsubstantial threat to public safety or national security. Holmes famously stated, “The\n\nmost stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire\n\nin a theatre and causing a panic.” This case underscores that speech is instrumental—it\n\nmay be restricted to prevent imminent harm, reflecting the Court's recognition of limits\n\nwhen other democratic values are at stake.\n\n61. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942): The Court upheld the conviction\n\nof a man for uttering \"fighting words,\" defined as speech that by its very utterance inflicts\n\ninjury or incites an immediate breach of the peace. The Court declared, “Such utterances\n\nare no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value... that\n\nany benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in\n\norder and morality.” This case illustrates that freedom of speech is protected when it\n\ncontributes to public discourse but may be limited when it merely incites violence or\n\ndisorder.\n\n62. Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951): In *Dennis*, the Court upheld the\n\nconviction of Communist Party leaders under the Smith Act for advocating the violent\n\noverthrow of the government. The Court applied a balancing test, weighing the\n\ngovernment’s interest in national security against free speech rights. When speech poses\n\na substantial threat to national security, it may be curtailed. This ruling exemplifies the\n\ninstrumental nature of speech, recognizing that it is not absolute when national security is\n\nat risk.\n\n63. New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971) (Pentagon Papers Case):\n\nAlthough the Court ruled in favor of the New York Times and Washington Post, allowing\n\nthem to publish the Pentagon Papers, it acknowledged potential circumstances wherespeech might be limited to protect national security. Justice Potter Stewart emphasized\n\nthat freedom of the press is instrumental in “enlightening the public” and ensuring a\n\n“responsible government,” suggesting that free speech could be restricted in situations of\n\ndirect, imminent threat to national security.\n\n64. Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927): While the Court upheld the conviction of a\n\nwoman advocating the overthrow of the government, Justice Louis Brandeis, in his\n\nconcurring opinion, argued that free speech is essential for democratic governance\n\nbecause it enables open discussion and prevents tyranny. However, Brandeis also\n\nacknowledged that speech could be curtailed when it poses a “clear and present danger,”\n\nreinforcing the instrumental view of free speech in serving broader democratic ends.\n\n65. These precedents demonstrate the Supreme Court's long-standing practice of treating\n\nfreedom of speech as instrumental rather than absolute. The Court has consistently\n\nrecognized that free speech can and should be limited when it conflicts with other\n\nfundamental democratic values, such as public safety, national security, and political\n\nequality. Thus, the unrestricted amplification of corporate voices, as permitted by\n\n*Citizens United v. FEC*, should be reconsidered in light of this tradition."

      "title": "Distinguishing Citizens United from Precedents Protecting Free Speech as an Absolute Right",
      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n66. While the Supreme Court has upheld freedom of speech as an absolute or nearly absolute\n\nright in various precedents, these decisions have not threatened the fundamental purpose\n\nof free speech—namely, equality in democratic discourse—as *Citizens United* does. The\n\ncore purpose of the First Amendment is to ensure a robust, open, and fair democratic\n\ndiscourse in which all voices have an equal opportunity to be heard. This principle\n\nunderlies the Court’s strong protection of free speech rights in cases where speech is\n\ntreated as nearly absolute.\n\nThe Ends of Free Speech: Equality in Democratic Participation\n\n67. The primary end of the First Amendment is to safeguard the marketplace of ideas,\n\npromote vibrant public discourse, prevent government tyranny, and ensure that all\n\nindividuals have an equal opportunity to participate in the democratic process. This\n\nunderstanding is reflected in the Court’s historical decisions, which protect speech to\n\nprevent government suppression of ideas, maintain political equality, and promote an\n\ninformed citizenry.\n\nPrecedents That Protect Free Speech Without Threatening Equality\n\n70. Unlike *Citizens United*, previous cases that treat freedom of speech as absolute or nearly\n\nabsolute do so to protect individual expression and ensure equal participation in\n\ndemocratic discourse:71. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969): The Court held that the government could\n\nnot prohibit speech advocating illegal activity unless it is \"directed to inciting or\n\nproducing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" This\n\ndecision protects even the most marginalized or radical voices to ensure they can\n\nparticipate equally in the public debate.\n\n72. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989): The Court ruled that burning the American flag\n\nas a form of political protest is protected speech. This decision protects dissenting voices\n\nand political protesters, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of the popularity of their\n\nviews, have the freedom to express their opinions in the political sphere.\n\n73. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964): The Court established a high\n\nstandard for public officials to claim defamation, protecting critical speech to maintain an\n\n\"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\" public debate. This ruling prevents those in power\n\nfrom silencing criticism, ensuring all voices can contribute to public discourse.\n\n74. Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971): The Court overturned the conviction of a man\n\nfor wearing a jacket with offensive language, affirming that the government cannot\n\nprohibit speech based on its content, even if offensive. This decision reinforces the\n\nprinciple that all speech, regardless of how distasteful, deserves protection to preserve\n\nequality in the marketplace of ideas.\n\n75. Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443 (2011): The Court protected highly offensive speech at a\n\nmilitary funeral, emphasizing that speech on public issues, even if emotionally\n\ndistressing, is essential to self-government. This ruling underscores the need to protect\n\neven the most controversial voices to ensure a broad public debate.\n\nNone of These Precedents Permit Disproportionate Amplification of Certain Voices\n\n76. These precedents collectively protect free speech to prevent the government from\n\ncontrolling or suppressing ideas, but they do not grant an unequal right to free speech\n\nwhere wealthier or more powerful actors can dominate public discourse based on\n\neconomic power. In each of these cases, the Court’s decisions protect individual\n\nexpression to ensure equal participation in democratic discourse. None of these cases\n\nallows a single class of speakers to drown out others by virtue of their financial resources\n\nor economic power.\n\nCitizens United Creates Systemic Inequality in Free Speech\n\n77. In contrast, *Citizens United* permits unlimited corporate political spending, inherently\n\ngiving wealthier entities—corporations and wealthy individuals—a disproportionately\n\nlouder voice in the political process than average citizens. This disparity fundamentally\n\ndistorts the democratic process, creating significant inequality in political influence and\n\nundermining the intended purpose of free speech as a means of equal participation.78. By granting corporations the right to spend unlimited amounts in political campaigns,\n\n*Citizens United* effectively elevates corporate speech over that of individuals, creating a\n\nscenario where financial power equates to political power. This outcome undermines the\n\nFirst Amendment’s purpose of facilitating democratic governance by skewing political\n\ndebate in favor of the wealthiest actors. In doing so, *Citizens United* departs from the\n\nprinciples that protect free speech to achieve its democratic end—ensuring equal\n\nparticipation in public discourse.\n\nThe Need to Reaffirm the Instrumental Purpose of Free Speech\n\n79. The precedents treating free speech as nearly absolute have done so to protect the\n\ndemocratic purpose of the First Amendment—ensuring equality in public discourse,\n\npreventing government suppression, and maintaining a fair marketplace of ideas. *Citizens*\n\n*United* undermines this purpose by allowing financial inequality to dictate political\n\ninfluence, creating a privileged class of speakers who can unduly shape elections,\n\nlegislation, and public policy. This concentration of influence is contrary to the\n\nconstitutional goal of political equality and fair representation."

This change\n\nsuggests that corporate money can directly influenceHere's a continuation of the redrafted\n\nsection with all specific examples included, further refined for organization and style:\n\nReal-World Examples of Citizens United's Impact on Democratic Governance\n\n82. The *Citizens United* decision has profoundly affected American politics by enabling\n\nwealthy individuals and corporations to exert disproportionate influence over political\n\noutcomes. This shift undermines the democratic principle of equal participation in public\n\ndiscourse. The following examples demonstrate how financial power, rather than the\n\nmerit of ideas or the will of the people, increasingly determines political influence:\n\n83. Senator Kyrsten Sinema:\n\nSenator Sinema began her career with a strong opposition to corporate campaigncontributions and, in 2017, voted against corporate tax cuts. However, by 2021, after\n\nreceiving over $2.5 million from corporate PACs, primarily from the pharmaceutical and\n\nfinancial sectors, her positions shifted significantly. She opposed increasing taxes on\n\ncorporations and wealthy individuals and reducing prescription drug costs for Medicare\n\nrecipients. This shift suggests that corporate money can directly influence legislative\n\nbehavior, undermining democratic representation and the principle of equal speech under\n\nthe First Amendment.\n\n84. Senator Joe Manchin:\n\nSimilarly, Senator Joe Manchin, while denying that his decisions are influenced by\n\ncampaign contributions, received over $1 million from the oil and gas industry in 2022,\n\nup from $63,700 in 2020. His votes have been critical in blocking legislation that would\n\nraise taxes on the wealthy and support green energy initiatives, aligning with the interests\n\nof his corporate donors. This example illustrates how substantial contributions from\n\nspecific industries can shape legislative outcomes, distorting democratic principles by\n\nfavoring the interests of wealthy donors over constituents.\n\n85. Senator Susan Collins:\n\nSenator Collins's voting record on environmental issues shifted after she began receiving\n\nincreased financial support from the oil and gas industry. While she once co-sponsored\n\nlegislation to cap carbon emissions and opposed drilling in protected areas, her recent\n\nvotes have favored expanding fossil fuel projects. Her contributions from this sector rose\n\nfrom $85,000 in 2016 to $377,000 by the 2020 election cycle. This example highlights\n\nhow corporate donations can lead to policy reversals, challenging the integrity of\n\ndemocratic representation.\n\n86. Senator Mitch McConnell:\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell’s use of a super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, and a\n\nsecretive dark money group, One Nation, demonstrates the influence of anonymous\n\ndonations. These entities raised over $172 million in 2020 alone from undisclosed\n\nsources, using these funds to influence elections nationwide. Such practices undermine\n\ntransparency and accountability, fundamental elements of democratic governance, by\n\nallowing a few wealthy entities to shape political outcomes without public scrutiny.\n\n87. Former President Donald Trump:\n\nSince leaving office, former President Donald Trump has used donations to his PACs,\n\nincluding the Make America Great Again (MAGA) PAC and Save America PAC, to\n\ncover over $100 million in legal expenses for various lawsuits and investigations,\n\nincluding those unrelated to his presidency or campaign activities. By exploiting legal\n\nloopholes and weak enforcement of campaign finance laws, Trump has been able to use\n\nfunds originally raised for political campaigns to pay for personal legal matters, testing\n\nthe boundaries of existing regulations. This example highlights how political figures can\n\nleverage PACs and dark money groups to deflect personal costs, further distorting\n\ndemocratic governance.88. Impact of Non-Party Groups and Dark Money:\n\nSpending by non-party groups has surged post-*Citizens United*, reaching approximately\n\n$4.5 billion in the decade following the decision—compared to $750 million in the two\n\ndecades prior. These groups often outspend the candidates themselves, overshadowing\n\nvoter voices. Concurrently, dark money—political spending by nonprofits that do not\n\ndisclose donors—rose from $129 million to $963 million in the same period. Many of\n\nthese contributions come from corporations, some with indirect foreign funding, further\n\ncomplicating transparency and accountability in elections.\n\n89. Link Between Spending and Election Outcomes:\n\nData shows a direct correlation between money spent and election success: candidates\n\nwith the most financial backing have won 92.34% of the time in the House and 74% of\n\nthe time in the Senate since the 2000 election cycle. This trend emphasizes how financial\n\npower increasingly determines electoral success, marginalizing less-funded candidates\n\nand undermining democratic fairness.\n\n90. Super PACs and Megadonors:\n\nSuper PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited funds, have concentrated financial\n\npower in the hands of a few wealthy donors. The top ten super PAC donors alone have\n\ncontributed approximately $1.1 billion since *Citizens United*. This concentration of\n\ninfluence allows a small group to exert outsized impact over political decisions,\n\nnarrowing the scope of public debate and policy choices available to elected officials.\n\n91. State-Level and Local Impact:\n\nThe effects of *Citizens United* are not confined to federal elections. For example, in\n\nMontana, corporate money surged into state elections after a century-old ban on\n\ncorporate spending was overturned. In California, independent expenditures in state races\n\nincreased by over 6,000% within six years. These trends demonstrate how corporate and\n\noutside money can heavily influence state and local elections, often at the expense of\n\ngrassroots candidates and community-driven policies."

      "content_level_3": "\n\n\n94. Given the foregoing arguments, this petition respectfully requests that the Court issue a\n\ndeclaratory judgment stating that the decision in *Citizens United v. Federal Election*\n\n*Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), is inconsistent with the Constitution's intended\n\nobjectives and grant injunctive relief to limit corporate political expenditures. This will\n\nhelp preserve the foundational democratic values embedded in our constitutional\n\nframework.\n\n95. This petition has demonstrated that *Citizens United* represents an unjustified departure\n\nfrom the principle of stare decisis, disregarding established precedents such as *Austin v.*\n\n*Michigan Chamber of Commerce*, 494 U.S. 652 (1990), and *McConnell v. Federal*\n\n*Election Commission*, 540 U.S. 93 (2003). These precedents acknowledged the\n\ngovernment’s compelling interest in limiting corporate influence over elections to protect\n\ndemocratic integrity and political equality. By overturning these decisions without\n\nadequate justification and disregarding reliance interests, *Citizens United* undermined the\n\nconsistency and predictability that stare decisis is meant to safeguard.\n\n96. Moreover, this petition has applied a rigorous framework for prioritizing competing\n\nconstitutional values, distinguishing between those that serve as means (such as freedom\n\nof speech) and those that are ends in themselves (such as political equality and preventing\n\ncorruption). When these values conflict, greater weight must be given to those that\n\ndirectly serve as constitutional ends, as these are integral to achieving the core objectives\n\nof \"establishing Justice\" and \"promoting the general Welfare.\" Therefore, when\n\nunrestricted corporate speech threatens political equality or fosters corruption, limitations\n\nbecome necessary to protect the broader constitutional values enshrined in the Preamble.\n\n97. To further illustrate, the broad interpretation of corporate free speech rights under\n\n*Citizens United* is akin to empowering a single voice with unlimited volume in a crowded\n\nroom. Although everyone theoretically has the right to speak, the voice with the greatest\n\namplification dominates, effectively drowning out others and silencing diverse\n\nperspectives. This unchecked amplification distorts the foundational purpose of free\n\nspeech: ensuring an equal and fair opportunity for all to participate in democratic\n\ndiscourse. By reconsidering *Citizens United*, the Court would effectively return the\n\n\"volume\" of corporate speech to a level conducive to the true ends of free speech, where\n\nall individuals have an equal opportunity to be heard, thus preserving the democratic\n\nprocess as intended by the framers.\n\n98. Reconsideration is necessary to restore the integrity of democratic governance, uphold\n\nthe Constitution's intended objectives, and realign corporate speech rights with the\n\ndemocratic principle that every citizen’s voice should have equal weight in public\n\ndiscourse. This action will prevent any single interest from overpowering the democratic\n\nprocess, ensuring that the Constitution’s values of equality, integrity, and public trust\n\nremain at the core of our political system.99. Reconsidering *Citizens United* is thus not only a constitutional necessity but also a moral\n\nimperative—ensuring that the democratic process remains accessible and fair to all\n\ncitizens, not just those with the most significant financial resources."
