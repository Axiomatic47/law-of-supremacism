Define a \"supremacist assertion\" as a necessary condition for sustained social conflict.\n2. Formally express this as a universal logical statement.\n3. Confirm logically whether sustained social conflict can exist if no supremacist assertion is present.\n\n```\n\n**Prompt 2:**¬†Validate Logical Form of Egalitarianism and Peace\n\n```\nPlease formally prove that absolute equality prevents sustained social conflict:\n1. Define \"egalitarian state\" as one in which no entity asserts superiority or hierarchy.\n2. Express this principle as a formal logical theorem.\n3. Demonstrate logically that sustained social conflict cannot persist in a strictly egalitarian system.\n\n```"
