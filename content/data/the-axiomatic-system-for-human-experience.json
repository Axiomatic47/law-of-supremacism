Verbal Explanation of the Peace Stability Condition**\n\n### **ðŸ”¹ What Does This Mean Conceptually?**\n\n* **Peace is not an independent variable; it is the final emergent property**Â of a system in whichÂ **Truth (T) and Wisdom (W) are maximized.**\n* WhenÂ **Truth is fully known (T â†’ 1.0),**Â deception, ignorance, and falsehoods no longer distort reality.\n* WhenÂ **Wisdom is maximized (W â†’ 1.0),**Â individuals make decisions that align with long-term, sustainable well-being.\n* **Peace (P) does not need to be forced; it arises naturally**Â from a condition where all other factors (identity, free will, knowledge, truth, and wisdom) are in balance.\n\n- - -\n\n## **2.
